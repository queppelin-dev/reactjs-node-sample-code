### Dependencies

You have to install MongoDB locally, or else if you want to use remote db connections, please change db.js in the root directory accordingly.

### How To Run The Server

Navigate to the root directory of the server.  

Open your terminal and type "npm install" to get all packages.  

Once you've got all the packages, you can run "node index.js" to start the server.  

You can use PM2 or nodemon according to your convenience if you want.
